##Dev Ed Rock Paper Scissors Tutorial

This is another Rock Paper Scissors Tutorial I went through and decided to tests some of my JS knowledge. Before going through my Code Institute JS module, I went through this and really struggled with it. There were a few errors that I came accross and couldn't fix due to my lack of JS knowledge. Now I think I have sufficient knowledge to be able to trouble shoot it.
